# 🛒  React Product Quantity Counter App

This is a React-based product quantity counter application where users can adjust the quantity of individual items using plus (+) and minus (−) buttons. The system ensures that the quantity stays within a defined range (1 to 10). It uses React hooks (useState), clean UI with CSS styling, and alerts users when limits are exceeded.
